# About the project

In this repository you will find the projects of the official Create With Code Unity course. This is the [official course page.](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code).

These projects were created following this tutorial. I have decided to upload them to Github in case anyone has any difficulties with the course so that they can consult the code or a finished project.

## Unity Version

2022.3.3f1
